# Flags — the same ROM, now with an opinion

A conditional jump is where a machine stops being a player piano: JZ does one of two things depending on what just happened. Set the opcode to 0011 (JZ) and clock to T4. With the Z switch off, nothing lights. Turn Z on and the same step asserts Ei and Lp — the operand goes to the program counter and the machine jumps. Not one gate was added: the two flags are simply two more ADDRESS lines on the control store, which grows from 128 bytes to 512. That is the whole trade microcode buys you, and it is why adding instructions to a SAP-2 is a programming job rather than a wiring one.

**Teaches:** conditional execution: flags as ADDRESS lines, so a branch costs bytes not gates

## What to do

Set the DIP switches and watch the outputs. The build needs 5 breadboards — real logic runs out of holes quickly.

Every chip gets +5 V and GND — an IC with no power does nothing, and a floating input does something worse: it reads whatever the room is doing. That is what the 10 kΩ pull-downs prevent.

## What you should see

| opcode and flags | what T4 does |
|---|---|
| JZ, Z=0 | nothing at T4 |
| JZ, Z=1 | Ei + Lp — it jumps |
| JC, C=0 | nothing |
| JC, C=1 | Ei + Lp |
| LDA, any flags | unchanged |
| store | 128 bytes -> 512 |
